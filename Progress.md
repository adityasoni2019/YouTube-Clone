##### In this commit
1. Deleting the default page. 
2. Setting up Tailwind
    - Installing Tailwind using the `npm i -D tailwindcss` (cause, we just want this in dev dependency)
    - And, then, we'll get the tailwind.config.js using the `npx tailwindcss init`
    - Mentioning the type of files, that tailwind has to sort of track.
